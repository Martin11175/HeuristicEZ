A reference implementation of Microsoft's EZ indoor positioning system in Matlab (2015b) with some heuristic variants supplied for comparison.


Please contact martinhiggs85@googlemail.com or iain.bate@york.ac.uk for a paper to reference when extending for academic use. Otherwise please give credit where credit is due.

This implementation is provided as a reference implementation for experimentation primarily. Use in other projects is acceptable but the software is provided as-is and as such the authors accept no liability and provide no guarantee when it is used.
